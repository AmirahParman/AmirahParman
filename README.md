Hello!

My name is Amirah and I’m a Learning & Development personnel who has recently developed a passion for programming.


I’m fascinated by web development and I’m currently learning how to build websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am looking to expand my portfolio of web projects and connect with other developers to learn from their insights.


You can contact me through GitHub or LinkedIn. 
I’m always keen to learn new things and appreciate any feedback that can help me improve my skills.

Thank you for checking out my profile! 😊
