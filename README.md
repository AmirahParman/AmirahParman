Hi, Iâ€™m Amirah, a new coder who has just recently discovered the exciting world of programming. 

Iâ€™m greatly interested in web development and Iâ€™m currently learning how to create websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Iâ€™m looking to create more web projects and start networking with other developers and learn from their experiences. 

You can reach me by sending me a message on GitHub or LinkedIn. 
Iâ€™m eager to learn new things and always open to feedbacks to improve my skills. 

Thank you for visiting my profile! ðŸ˜Š
