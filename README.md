Hello!

My name is Amirah and I’m a Learning & Development personnel who has recently developed a passion for programming. I’m fascinated by web development and I’m learning how to build websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### Currently following:  

* 📖 *Javascript from Beginner to Professional by Laurence Lars Svekis, Maaike van Putten & Rob Percival*  
* 👨‍Udemy: *The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023*
  

I am looking to expand my portfolio of web projects and connect with other developers to learn from their insights.


You can contact me through GitHub or LinkedIn. 
I’m always keen to learn new things and appreciate any feedback that can help me improve my skills.

Thanks for checking out my profile! 😊
